    "- This year as a CSA student my goals are to improve my java skills and learn about different types of systems such as thymeleaf and jwt and create a project. As a group member and a student I want to make sure that we are utilizing the creativity weeks to have a set out plan for our project. Additionally I want to make sure that my skills are shown in a project that not only is a reflection of my passions but also showcases all the the content I have learned, this is because duirng trimester 1 I felt a lot the information that we learned on college board and java, was given to me but by doing projects and applications like the collegeboard mcq's, sorting projects, and passion projects i start to see what I learn and what information that I lack. Therefore I want to make sure that I am on top of the skills and appyling them to projects."

This is becuase I want to learn and progress into becoming a better programmer. For this trimester my groups initial idea is about a rate my class and get review from different students however the only thing that could be the problem is that the data can be limited to our school so a reflection may be changing that to a district application and advertise it to others stuendts witin other schools.\n",
