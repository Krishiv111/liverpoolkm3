# Using Night At The Museum to plan for our two trimester project 

 -  N@tm allowed our group to get a better understanding of what a we can do to improve our user reflection, this started off by getting test data from  diffferent students at the expo by asking them to sign up with their classes they currently take and we tested our compare feature along with our chat feature, many students loved the idea that they could compare classes with uses but something that we eed to improve on and were requested many times to get be changed away was the id system, as we would fetch by each users id but we realized ususally you wouldnt remember other peoples id and should be able to chat with their friends and compare their schedules with name.

- Some addition I am looking to add to my personal feature is a way to link my feature with the chat feature adding a htpp that links features based on the login and jwt feature currently we have  cookies set up with the login and the classes set up, however we dont havr anything set up to link teh persons login so they can only message peopel who they have similar classes with. We will also make sure to integrate a clubs feature that similarly to the classes feature alow yo ut ot compare your classes and feature to ultimatley make a friend system and connect the people together. 



# Reflection about individual/team presentation 
- Our pitch was very good due to the fact that we were able to keep our audience engaged from students to parents and together. Also we were able to get feedback from adults who worked as backend developers at various companies that deal with different niches within tech, we were able to get their insight on our coding practices and structurs and packages used within the langauge of java we even got a recoomendation to downlaod a package called tests in order to help us easier creates column and rows within our sql databae .

- Some glows we could have was with the peopple we need to be more direct and intnetional when we speak becuase often we  would get side tracked and away from the principle of our topic and talk about different things. This is something Mr mort has also gotteen us to improve in our live review as he still says ocasionally we have some "fluff" in our presentaion not taking about the core prinicples of our project.

# Something That impressed me wihtin CompSci 

- A project I really liked was the real estate CSP project I thinked it was really cool how they ipmplemented houses from san deigo area to create a database as it reminded me of something I created for my computer science project wihtin CSP, I liked hwo they implemented jwt and had talked about diffrent projects. Somethign I took away from their project and would like to implement it in mine was the UI i liked their styling and how they implemented a consistent style which is an area of my project that my team lacks.
