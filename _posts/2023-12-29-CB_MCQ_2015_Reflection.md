-  On this 2015 MCQ I earned a score of 27/39, I did this mcq with any exterior knowlege, to show where I really stand, I think some of these java skills I still need to master as I have never had experience in java before this class and since I am not the fastest learner so learning all 10 units in 1 sprint made me overlook a lot of the key information as I was experienceing all the information in a quick time period, however to tailor this over this winter break I am going through all collegeboard videos on the 10 units as well as doing extra practice problems from looking at the student lessons from last trimester, I am doing about 1 unit spending 2 days of time about 2 hours a day trying to grasp this information so when I comeback from winterbreak I will be a better programmer.

Unit 2  String Class

Topics: Strings Class and Concatenation 

- Reflection: Here when breakign down the problem I was initally confused by 
```indexof("art") !=-1```,but know I understand this to mean that if the word contains art this shouuld be deemed to false, therefore my option C is incorrect due to the fact that harmchortlerowbar wont even return the word art so you cant get the index of art even when you do add the words together, therefore A is correct becuase “rattrapsimilartoday” results in the word "art" in between the words similar and today making you return true.

Topics: Inner and Outter Nested Iteration
 
- Reflection: Here the code runs through inner and outer loops of the code assigning the value 1-6 for outer loop and then itterates value for the inner loop of outer value to 6 using the mod to check if there is no remainder when dividing by 2 meaning that the inner value is even when being divided by 2 then prints it resulting in a print of 2,4,6 there fore the other values arent printed from 1-6 now to determine the pattern the code starts with each set of even numbers, it moves to a new line to start the next iteration. My answer was completely off becuase it would mean that outer wasnt even set giving you a linear pattern. 


# Question 9

Time Spent 10.05? (not sure this is correct I remember answering the question pretty quickly)

- Math.random is the usage of using 0-1 but not including 1 so if its multiplied by 6 you get the values 0-5 not including 5 therefore to find the sum you have to add them up however I isunderstood the portion of the +2 because I didnt see why we needrd but it makes sense that it shifts the values by tw oas it can be up to 6 sided die not 5 so we miss one side form each of the sides but couldnt you also just multiply by 7 instead of 6 so you get 0-6 not including 6?
